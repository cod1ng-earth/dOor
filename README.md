## Everything's decentralized but not your Đoor: Event ticket tokens

#### why is the door of Dappcon operated by h00mans? :thinking: :robot: 
 
At Dappcon we're seeing so many decentralized concepts: Prediction Markets, DAOs, 2nd-level services, Oracles, Empowerment, Privacy... gosh, some people even want to divide a city's space into tiles to sell and own them as a token.

Did you pay "real" money to attend Dappcon (or any other conference on planet earth)? If so, did you also use your credit card to pay for admission? Did you notice today morning that we had to present a **QR code** at the entrance? Hell, to get my EthBerlinZwei badge I was supposed to disclose my email address to someone typing it into his Mac.

## the idea 
Lets change that. In a way that it's truly usable. **Build an app that I can use to "buy" a ticket and to "open the door" / "get into the venue"**  No fancy "ticket economics, lets trade Metallica tickets" here. Just a "simple" decentralized and publicly useable "lets open the door with a ticket token" Đapp and its necessary counterparts.

## on the road:
- work around the foxy Metamask UX blocker
- use any ready made service that we can find and that could help us (OpenZeppelin GSN, etherlime, Chainlink, Nym / jolocom / uport / ...).
- "fiat payments" should be possible: you can  *still*  use any payment you consider secure but you don't have to
- adapt proven platforms for event content data
	- token for RSVPs on meetup.com
	- link token to eventbrite events (and take over their fubar payment system)
	- your favorite ticket / event management platform here
- open the door by...
	- solving a challenge
	- decrypting a secret phrase (encrypted by the bumper)
	- transfer a unique ticket token to the bumper's wallet

## How to achieve that?
That's why we're here. I started thinking about these issues on our internal company hackathon 2 weeks ago. Came up with 10 lines of solidity that look wrong. I'm open for any idea.

## Who am I (Stefan)?
I did PHP. I'm doing a lot of Javascript - a lot! In Vue and React, and sometimes even Vanilla. I know my way around relational and nonrelational dbs (Mongo's the favorite). I can do Python. I once wrote a Feigenbaum app in Go. I read everything about Solidity and can deploy a smart contract to ropsten, call methods on it, start ganache locally, use openzeppelin. I fixed my own docker setup and I switched back to Linux 6 weeks ago after using Mac for 7years. I attended and won hackathons before (Blockstack March 18 & Blockchain Hackathon Stuttgart this Feb, using IOTA).

## Who are you? / Skills
A coder. Male, female, React, JS, Solidity, Vyper, Python, I don't care. You're able to focus on a simple problem with complex implications and you want to write code during the hackathon. Only real requirement: you must know your way around git and your local setup. I'm happy to board anyone on if that's needed. What we really can need:

[x] Solidity / Vyper hackers
[x] people with a some track record of token creation 
[x] "read a QR code with a mobile device and make sense of it" (note that web3 is *not* really working with React Native!!)
[x] UX (material ui / styled components / grommet preferred but Bootstrap will do)
[x] if you *really* want: make the bumper an IoT device that even prints a physical attendance badge :D  

I'm here for you, listening :)
