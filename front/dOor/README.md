## Build / Setup

``` bash
npm install
nuxt
```

go to http://localhost:3000. The contract address is currently baked into the source code (users.js, index.js. Change it to your contract address)

You'll need to have MetaMask installed to interact with the contracts :)

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
